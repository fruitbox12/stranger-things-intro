Intro sequence of the popular Netflix TV series "Stranger Things", rendered using HTML `<canvas/>`. It's a fun side-project that I did to demonstrate the possibilities of modern web technologies & also to see how far I can push it.

You can clone the repo & use it for your own purposes, although not mandatory but it'd be great if you credit me as the author(link to my [Github](https://github.com/mudassir0909/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/guesswhat4951) should be fine).
